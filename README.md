To ensure that hospitals and clinics are equipped to deliver optimal care to the heightened influx of patients during the influenza season, they frequently engage the services of medical staffing agencies. These specialized agencies provide temporary healthcare personnel to meet the surging demand for qualified medical professionals.

In my capacity as an analyst, my core responsibilities entailed translating intricate business requirements and inquiries into well-defined analytical questions. Subsequently, I meticulously sourced and curated data resources to address these inquiries comprehensively. Following the data collection phase, I embarked on a rigorous analysis, extracting valuable insights, drawing substantiated conclusions, and formulating actionable recommendations. These findings were communicated to stakeholders through a structured and informative video presentation.

Notable datasets employed in my analytical work included the following:

 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Influenza Deaths Data: This dataset encompasses influenza-related mortality statistics categorized by geography, time, age, and gender.

 United States Census Bureau Population Data: This dataset provides demographic information structured by geography, serving as a foundational resource for population analysis.

 CDC Counts of Influenza Laboratory Test Results: This dataset comprises survey-based counts of influenza laboratory test results, organized by state.

CDC Survey of Flu Shot Rates in Children: This dataset encompasses survey data related to flu vaccination rates among children.

These datasets played a crucial role in the formulation of data-driven insights and recommendations to inform strategic decision-making.
